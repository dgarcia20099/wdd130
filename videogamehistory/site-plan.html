        Video game history
        The history of video games is long, and has a lot of main points on this page then I will go over the main key points of video game history. 
	      October 18th 1958- the first video game for entertainment
        The first ever video game created for entertainment was created by William Higginbottom. Higgenbottom was a researcher at the Brooklyn national library, he noticed that a lot of science exibits were not interactive and so he invented the first video game
        Tennis for two was run on an oscilloscope and showed a simple representation of a tennis court.
	      1971- the first arcade cabinet
        The first arcade cabinet was called computer space.
        September 1972- the first home console
        The first home game console was the Magnavox odyssey it had very simple games and mostly relied on overlays placed on the screen in order to play different games
        1976- the second generation of consoles-
        The second generation of consoles is when we see the start of the use of video game cartridges because of these cartridges then many games had to be released for these consols the most famous console of this generation was the atari 2600
        1979- the foundation of activation
        Activation is known as the first 3rd party video game developer (a company that makes videogames but does not make the game console itself).  It was founded by 4 emplyees of Atari who felt that they weren’t being recognized and compensated fairly.
        The four employees were David crane, alan miller, larry Kaplan, and bob whitehead. They all left because they were not satisfied with the management, and left to form their own company, deciding to form their own studio to independently develop games for the Atari consoles
        1983- American video game crash
        In 1983 then the American video game market crashed because of a lack of trust in game developers.
        1991-1994 popularity of disks
        In these years then disks started to replace cartridges because they were cheaper and could hold more data allowing for improvements to videogames
        Sony in 1994 released the first playstation. The playstation 1 was sony’s first attempt at entering the video game market after a deal between them and Nintendo fell through.

        1985- Nintendo entertainment system
        Nintendo in Japan released the famicom, but they wanted to release it in the US, so they made it sound not like a console and took measures to make sure that games had higher quality,, including limiting how 3rd party developers could publish games for the console
