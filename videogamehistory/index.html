                            relied on overlays placed on the screen in order to play different games

                            The second generation of consoles is when we see the start of the use of video game
                            cartridges because of these cartridges then many games had to be released for these consols the most famous console of this generation was the atari 2600

                        <p>
                             Activation is known as the first 3rd party video game developer (a company that makes videogames but does not make the game console itself). 
                             It was founded by 4 emplyees of Atari who felt that they weren’t being recognized and compensated fairly. The four employees were David crane, 
                             alan miller, larry Kaplan, and bob whitehead. They all left because they were not satisfied with the management, 
                             and left to form their own company, deciding to form their own studio to independently develop games for the Atari consoles

                             In 1983 then the American video game market crashed because of a lack of trust in game developers.

                             In these years then disks started to replace cartridges because they were cheaper and could hold more data allowing for improvements to videogames 
                             Sony in 1994 released the first playstation. The playstation 1 was sony’s first attempt at entering the video game market after a deal between them
                             and Nintendo fell through.
