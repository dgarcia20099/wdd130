    <h2>Daniel Garcia</h2>
    <p>
        I am Daniel Garcia. I have 5 siblings and have been a member my whole life. I am a child developement major and am in my sophomore year of BYU Idaho.
        I enjoy playing games and reading. One thing that I like about BYU idaho is the spirit that is on the campus.

    <p>
        I served in the ogden utah mission and got home last august. I enjoyed my mission and had a lot of good memories from serving.
        I learned a lot about the gospel, and met a lot of good people.

    <h2>favorite scripture</h2>
    <p>my favorite scripture is d&c 76:22-24 which says
    </p>
    <p>
        22 And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!
        23 For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Fatherâ€”
        24 That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</p>
